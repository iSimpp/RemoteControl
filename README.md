# Natro Macro Remote Control

## Overview
This project contains a Discord bot implemented in Python using the Discord.py library. The bot includes features such as taking screenshots, controlling macro functionalities, and interacting with your PC via slash commands.

## Features
- **Screenshot Command**: Allows you to take a screenshot of your screen and send it to a Discord channel.
- **Macro Control Commands**: Provides commands to start, pause, and exit a natro macro.

## Setup
1. **Install Python**: Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/).
2. **Install Dependencies**: This process will be automated when you run the code so no worries.



## Usage
Once the bot runs and connects to your Discord server, you can interact with it using slash commands. Here are some example commands:

- `/screenshot`: Take a screenshot of the screen.
- `/start`: Start the macro automation process by pressing F1.
- `/pause`: Pause the macro by pressing F2.
- `/exit`: Exit the macro by pressing F3.
